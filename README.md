# Uber calculator

Uber Calculator README
A common hurdle when starting out as an Uber driver is the uncertainty surrounding the financial aspects of the job. While enticing claims suggest earnings of around $31 per hour, this only tells half the story. In my view, Uber could potentially benefit more by offering transparency and improved tools for drivers to accurately calculate their actual earnings, considering factors like the varying maintenance costs of different car models. This could be achieved by gathering data about cars and introducing a feature where drivers can input their personal car expenses to determine their exact hourly rate. This would give new drivers a clearer picture of what they're signing up for.

Here's a bit of my personal experience. I drove a 2012 Ford Focus, clocking in 5000 miles each month. After several months, maintenance issues started popping up and the labor costs in Texas were higher than what I was used to in Illinois. I crunched the numbers and discovered that I could have saved $2000 if I had opted to rent a car from the beginning, and I would still have had my old car.

This motivated me to create Uber Calculator, a web application specifically designed for Uber drivers. Its aim is to provide a transparent, real-time understanding of drivers' earnings. It serves as a comprehensive dashboard that not only tracks work hours but also dynamically calculates actual hourly earnings after accounting for all operational expenses.

Uber Calculator is essentially the tool I wish I had when I started driving for Uber. It seeks to be a vital resource for drivers, offering a clear view of their earnings and assisting in better financial planning. With a clear breakdown of profits and expenses, drivers can strategize to maximize their earnings and efficiently manage their time on the platform.

On another note, consider this project as my resume for Uber. I'm building something that directly addresses a need I experienced first-hand and that could potentially benefit the broader Uber driving community.
